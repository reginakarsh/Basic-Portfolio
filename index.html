           <p><img class="headshot" src="./assets/images/headshot.jpg" alt="Headshot" width="280" height="350">I'm half Russian and half Jewish. I grew up in Los Angeles with a widowed mother who didn't speak much English, which pushed me to be assertive and outgoing. Summer in Russia is awesome. There was a forest behind my grandmother's neighborhood where I could get lost for hours visiting the zoo, the ducks in the swamp, and picking nuts and raspberries.</p>

          <p>After high school, I spend about ten years trying to figure out what career I wanted to pursue. Eventually, I finally graduated with a Master's Degree in Philosophy. I'm still not entirely sure about my path. Last year, I graduated from a relationship coaching progam and now I'm studying web development.</p>

         <p>I'm quite fond of being a mom, though for a bit, I wasn't sure how that was going to go. My ten-year-old is quite the magical creature. Married life is nice. We are crazy about traveling. I like getting back rubs. I finally convinced my husband to run half-marathons with me, which we like to do in the mountains in the Bay Area. Every December, for my birthday, I run the California International Marathon. </p>

   * Make sure to `git add .` and `git commit -m "initial site files"`. Then type `git push origin master` to push your changes to your GitHub repo.

5. Reference these screenshots for your site:

   ![Portfolio About](Images/portfolio-about-me.png)

   ![Portfolio Contact](Images/portfolio-contact.png)

   ![Portfolio Gallery](Images/portfolio-gallery.png)

   * **IMPORTANT** Your site's layout must match the designs in these screenshots. You'll find the specs for these designs below. 

6. When you create a website, it's standard practice to code your HTML files before writing any CSS and to write up one HTML file before moving onto the next. Write your HTML semantically, too: 

   * If something is a heading, you use a heading tag. 
   * If something is a list, you use an unordered or ordered list tag.
   * So on and so forth.

7. The content for the `index.html` should be unique to **you**. 

   * Write a paragraph or two about yourself. Make it fun, show your personality!
   * The main logo where it says "Your Name" should say your name. This may make the logo section smaller or wider depending on how long your name isâ€”that is fine and expected.
   * Add, commit, and push your code to GitHub often, especially when you complete a page.

8. After all of your HTML is written, you can begin styling your pages using the `style.css` file you created.

   * Be sure to [validate your html](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input).
   * Consult the specs below these instructions for advice on styling your CSS files.

9. Push your changes to Github.

### Additional Specifcations

1. Colors _Pro-tip: Use the [Eye Dropper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/eye-dropper/hmdcmlfkchdmnmnmheododdhjedfccka) Chrome extension to find the colors used on web pages._
   * Teal color (used for headings and backgrounds): `#4aaaa5`
   * Regular font color (used for paragraphs and all text besides the headings): `#777777`
   * Main header background color: `#ffffff`
   * Main header border color: `#cccccc`
   * Footer background color: `#666666`
   * Main content background color: `#ffffff`
   * Main content border color: `#dddddd`

2. Fonts:
   * For heading fonts use `font-family: 'Georgia', Times, Times New Roman, serif;`.
   * For all other fonts use `'Arial', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif;`.

3. Profile Image Found on `index.html`:
   * Use a picture of yourself. 
   * If you don't have a picture, you can grab a placeholder image from [LoremPixel](http://lorempixel.com/). Save the images to your `images` folder.

4. Portfolio Images:
   * Placeholder images can be found at [LoremPixel](http://lorempixel.com/). 
   * Save the images to your `images` folder.

5. Background Images:
   * The background pattern used was found on [Subtle Patterns](https://subtlepatterns.com/). You can browse through that site and find whichever pattern you like.

6. Dimensions:
   * The entire content and the main section content area is `960px` wide.
   * Pro-tip: Use the [Page Ruler](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/page-ruler/jlpkojjdgbllmedoapgfodplfhcbnbpn/related?hl=en) extension to measure the size of elements.

### Bonus

1. Make your pages more sophisticated by adding style to text links, to image links, and to buttons for when a user hovers their cursor over them. A CSS hover tutorial can be found [here](http://www.codeitpretty.com/2013/06/how-to-use-css-hover-effects.html). 

2. You can use [Adobe Kuler](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/) to find colors that match the theme (in this case, the primary color is Teal `#4aaaa5`).

3. Make a "sticky footer." You will notice the dark grey footer will always rest just below the content. This is fine whenever your site has enough content to push it down past the height of most monitors. But if there isn't much content in the body, the footer could rest in the middle of the page:
   * Try to code the footer in a way that it will always remain at the bottom of the page, no matter how short the content is. A sticky footer tutorial can be found [here](https://css-tricks.com/couple-takes-sticky-footer/). 


* Don't forget to look into these concepts: `float`, `padding`, `margin`, `display`, `overflow`, `clear` and `text-align`.
